                    <h2>Our Project</h2>
                    <h3>RingMap</h3>
                    <p>Our project is an innovative campus navigation app designed to help students easily locate amenities within university buildings. As UVic students ourselves, we know how challenging it can be to find essential facilities, such as study spaces, accessible washrooms, or departmental offices, especially in larger or newly renovated buildings. Our app provides detailed floor plans and highlights key amenities, enabling students to navigate the campus more confidently. By making information readily available and accessible, we aim to enhance the UVic experience, helping students save time and reduce frustration as they explore the university’s diverse spaces.</p>
